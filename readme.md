This is a test project submission.

## Instructions
After doing the environment configuration and database migration the following must be done to generate sample data:
<br>
`php artisan db:seed`

## Note
The user's name must be unique in every comment. The initial idea was to create a user name selection to associate the comment to an existing user, else they are created. Only the latter got implemented for the meantime.
